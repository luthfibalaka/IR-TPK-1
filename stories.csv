One day, it was very cold and windy. Tom wanted to find a warm place to sleep. He saw a big house with a nice garden. He sneaked in through a hole in the fence. He saw a dog house with a soft blanket inside. He thought it was perfect for him.
He crawled into the dog house and curled up on the blanket. He felt cozy and happy. He did not know that the dog house belonged to Rex, a big, friendly dog who lived in the house.

He put Tom in a cage and called the animal shelter. He hoped they would find a good home for him. He felt sorry for him, but he knew he could not keep him. He already had Rex, who was his best friend.

Then they saw a big cloud that looked like nothing. It was just a big, white, fluffy cloud. It covered the sun and made the sky darker.
""What is that cloud, Anna?"" Ben asked, feeling scared.
""I don't know, Ben, it is a strange cloud. Maybe it is a monster cloud!"" Anna said, feeling scared too.
They hugged each other and wished the cloud would go away. They did not like the strange cloud.

Lily wanted to touch it anyway. She reached out her hand and poked the mushroom. It felt soft and wet. But then the mushroom broke and fell apart. Lily gasped.
""Oh no!"" Ben said. ""You broke the mushroom! What if it was someone's home? What if a bug lived there?""
Lily felt sorry. She did not mean to break the mushroom. She did not know it was so fragile. She looked at the pieces of the mushroom on the ground. She saw a small worm crawling out of one of them. She felt even more sorry.
""I'm sorry, worm,"" she said. ""I'm sorry, mushroom. I did not want to hurt you. I was just curious.""
Ben saw that Lily was sorry. He hugged her and said, ""It's okay, Lily. You did not know. Maybe we can find another mushroom for the worm. Maybe we can help it find a new home.""
Lily nodded. She wiped her tears and smiled. She and Ben looked around the garden for another mushroom. They found one that was smaller and white and had no spots. They carefully picked it up and brought it to the worm. They placed it near the broken mushroom and hoped the worm would like it.
""Here you go, worm,"" Lily said. ""This is a new mushroom for you. We hope you are happy. We are sorry for breaking your old mushroom.""
The worm wiggled and seemed to say thank you. Lily and Ben felt happy. They learned to be more careful with the things they observe. They also learned to say sorry when they make a mistake.

Then, they saw something shiny under a bush. They ran towards it, hoping it was gold or jewels. But when they got closer, they saw it was a frozen pond. It was very cold and slippery, and they could see fish and plants under the ice.
""Wow, look at that!"" Lily said. ""Maybe there is treasure under the ice!""
""Let's find out!"" Ben said. He took the hook and tried to break the ice with it. He hit the ice hard, but it did not crack. He hit it again, and again, but nothing happened.
""Be careful, Ben!"" Lily said. ""You might fall in!""
Ben did not listen. He wanted to find the treasure. He hit the ice harder and harder, until he made a small hole. He looked inside, and saw something shiny. He reached for it with his hook, but he lost his balance. He slipped and fell into the pond.
Lily screamed. She saw Ben go under the water. She was very scared. She did not know what to do. She wanted to help Ben, but she did not want to fall in too. She looked around, and saw a big stick. She grabbed it, and ran to the pond. She lay down on the ice, and reached for Ben with the stick.
""Ben, Ben, grab the stick!"" she shouted. ""I'll pull you out!""
Ben heard Lily's voice. He was very cold and wet. He saw the stick, and grabbed it. Lily pulled him out of the pond. He was shivering and coughing. He dropped the hook, and hugged Lily.
""Thank you, Lily!"" he said. ""You saved me!""
""I'm sorry, Ben!"" Lily said. ""I should have been more polite. I should have let you have the hook. It was your treasure.""
Ben shook his head. He smiled at Lily. He said, ""No, Lily, you are my treasure. The hook was just a hook. It was not worth it. You are my best friend.""

The swan nodded and swam away. Lily looked for another swan to feed. She saw one that was hidden behind some reeds. It was smaller than the other swans. It looked shy.
""Hello, swan! Do you want some bread?"" Lily called.
The hidden swan peeked out from the reeds. It saw Lily and the bread. It wanted the bread, but it was afraid of Lily. It stayed behind the reeds.
""Come on, swan! Don't be scared. I won't hurt you. I just want to be your friend,"" Lily said.

Tom screamed. He dropped his stick. He turned and ran. He ran back to Mia. He grabbed her hand. He said, ""Mia, you were right. The wolf is big and bad. Let's go home. I am sorry I was stubborn.""
Mia hugged him. She said, ""It's okay, Tom. I am glad you are safe. Let's go home. Maybe we can play something else tomorrow.""
They ran out of the woods. They did not look back. They did not hear the wolf howl again."
story-2154,"Sara and Ben were playing with their toys in the living room. They had a big box that they used as a house, a car, or a boat. They liked to pretend that they were on adventures.
""Let's go to the beach!"" Ben said, putting on his hat and sunglasses. He grabbed a towel and a bucket. ""We can make sand castles and find shells.""
""OK!"" Sara agreed, following him. She took her doll and a shovel. They dragged the box to the backyard, where there was a sandbox.
They put the box in the sand and climbed inside. They pretended that they were sailing on the ocean. They used the shovel and the bucket to make sand castles and dig holes. They found some rocks and sticks and pretended that they were shells and fish.
They had a lot of fun, but they also got very dirty. Sand was everywhere: on their clothes, in their hair, and on their toys. The sun was very hot and harsh. It made them thirsty and sweaty.
""Let's go inside and wash,"" Sara said, feeling sticky and itchy. ""We can have some juice and cookies.""
""OK,"" Ben said, feeling tired and thirsty. He grabbed the towel and the bucket. He helped Sara carry the box and the doll. They left the sandbox and went to the door.
But when they got there, they saw Mom waiting for them. She looked angry. She saw the sand and the dirt on them and on the floor.
""What have you done?"" she asked, in a loud and harsh voice. ""You made a big mess! You can't bring the box and the toys inside. They are too dirty. You have to wash them outside first. And then you have to wash yourselves. Go to the hose and spray everything. Now!""
Sara and Ben felt scared and sad. They did not mean to make Mom angry. They just wanted to have fun. They did not like the hose. It was cold and wet. They did not want to wash their toys. They liked them the way they were.
They started to cry. They dropped the box and the toys. They hugged each other.
""Please, Mom, don't be harsh,"" Sara said, in a small and soft voice. ""We are sorry. We love you.""
Mom saw their tears and heard their words. She felt sorry too. She realized that she was too harsh. She knelt down and hugged them.
""I'm sorry too,"" she said, in a gentle and kind voice. ""I love you too. I know you were just playing. But you have to be careful. Sand can hurt your skin and your eyes. And dirt can make you sick. You have to wash it off. It's good for you. I'll help you. Come on, let's go to the hose. It will be fun. And then we can have some juice and cookies. OK?""
Sara and Ben nodded. They felt better. They smiled. They took the box and the toys. They followed Mom to the hose. They washed everything. They laughed and splashed. They had fun.
They learned that washing was not so bad. And that Mom was not so harsh. She was just trying to keep them safe and clean. They loved her. And she loved them."

""Let's go and see!"" Sam said, excited. They got up and started to walk.

""Listen, Lila,"" dad said. ""We understand that you love your wish star, but you can't pack it. It will take up too much space and it might get lost or broken. And you don't need it to make wishes. You can make wishes in your heart, and they will be just as powerful.""
""Really?"" Lila asked.
""Really,"" mom said. ""Your heart is the most powerful wish maker. And you know what? You can share your wishes with Ben, and he can share his wishes with you. That way, you can both be happy and kind to each other.""

He did not care about the other animals and he did not listen to anyone. One day, he was sleeping under a tree when a mouse ran over his nose. The lion woke up and was very angry. He caught the mouse and said: ""How dare you disturb me? I will eat you for breakfast!""

The mouse heard the lion's roar and recognized his voice. He remembered how the lion had spared his life and he decided to help him. He ran to the lion and said: ""Mr. Lion, what is wrong? Can I help you?""
The lion was surprised and ashamed to see the mouse. He said: ""Oh, it's you. I have a thorn in my paw and it hurts a lot. But you can't help me. You are too weak and small.""
The mouse said: ""Don't say that, Mr. Lion. You may be big and strong, but I am smart and brave. Let me see your paw. Maybe I can pull out the thorn.""
The lion was doubtful, but he was also desperate. He said: ""All right, try it. But be careful. Don't hurt me more.""
The mouse climbed on the lion's paw and saw the thorn. He used his teeth and his claws and he pulled out the thorn. The lion felt a relief and thanked the mouse. He said: ""You are amazing, little mouse. You have saved me. You have proved that you can help me. I was wrong to laugh at you and to be proud and lazy. I am sorry. Can you forgive me?""
The mouse said: ""Of course, I forgive you, Mr. Lion. You have also proved that you can be kind and grateful. I am glad that we are friends. The moral is: A kindness is never wasted.""
The twins listened to the story and learned the moral. They looked at each other and said: ""We are sorry for fighting and crying. We should be kind and share. We should not be proud and lazy. We should be friends.""
The lady smiled and said: ""That's right, Tim and Kim. You have learned a valuable lesson. Now, go and play and have fun. And remember: A kindness is never wasted."""

""OK, Ben. I like your truck. It is big and strong. Let's trade,"" Lila said. She gave Ben her car and took his truck.
They played with their new toys for a while, but then Lila saw Ben's teddy. It was soft and cuddly. She wanted it too.
""Ben, can I trade you my ball for your teddy? I think your teddy is very cute. Please?"" Lila asked.
""OK, Lila. I like your ball. It is round and bouncy. Let's trade,"" Ben said. He gave Lila his teddy and took her ball.
They played with their new toys for a while, but then Lila saw Ben's book. It had pictures and words. She wanted it too.
""Ben, can I trade you my doll for your book? I think your book is very interesting. Please?"" Lila asked.
""OK, Lila. I like your doll. It is pretty and has a dress. Let's trade,"" Ben said. He gave Lila his book and took her doll.
They played with their new toys for a while, but then Ben realized he had nothing left. He had traded all his toys to Lila. He felt sad and angry.
""Lila, you are not fair. You took all my toys. I want them back. Give them to me now!"" Ben shouted.
""No, Ben. They are mine now. I traded them with you. You agreed. Go away!"" Lila shouted back.
They started to fight and pull each other's hair. They were not friends anymore. They were enemies.
A teacher saw them and came to stop them. She was not happy. She scolded them and took away all their toys. She said they had to learn to share and be nice.
Lila and Ben felt sorry and ashamed. They had no toys and no friends. They had made a bad trade. They wished they had never traded their toys. They wished they had played with them together and had fun. But it was too late. They had ruined their day."
story-2649,"Lily and Ben were twins, but they were very different. Lily liked to play with dolls and draw pictures. Ben liked to play with cars and build blocks. One day, they had to share a tray of cookies that their mom made for them.
""Let's pray first,"" Lily said. She closed her eyes and folded her hands. ""Thank you, God, for the cookies and for mom and dad and for Ben.""
Ben rolled his eyes. He did not like to pray. He wanted to eat the cookies right away. He opened his eyes and reached for the tray.
""Hey, stop!"" Lily said. She opened her eyes and saw Ben grabbing a cookie. ""That's not fair! You have to pray first!""
""No, I don't!"" Ben said. He bit the cookie and smiled. ""Mmm, yummy!""
Lily felt angry and sad. She wanted to share the cookies with Ben, but he did not care. She started to cry.
Mom heard Lily crying and came to see what was wrong. She saw the tray of cookies and Ben's crumbs on his mouth.
""What happened here?"" Mom asked.
""Lily wanted me to pray, but I didn't want to,"" Ben said.
""Lily, why did you want Ben to pray?"" Mom asked.
""Because it's good to thank God for what we have,"" Lily said.
Mom nodded. She understood how Lily felt. She also understood how Ben felt. She loved them both, even though they were different.
""Ben, I'm glad you like the cookies, but you should respect Lily's choice to pray. Praying is a way of talking to God and showing gratitude. You don't have to pray if you don't want to, but you should wait for Lily to finish before you take a cookie,"" Mom said.
""Sorry, Lily,"" Ben said. He felt a little sorry for making Lily cry.
""Lily, I'm proud of you for praying, but you should respect Ben's choice not to pray. Not everyone believes in God or prays the same way. You can pray for yourself and for Ben, but you can't force him to pray with you,"" Mom said.
""Sorry, Ben,"" Lily said. She felt a little sorry for being angry at Ben.
Mom smiled. She hugged them both and gave them each another cookie.
""Can we still play together?"" Ben asked.
""Of course we can,"" Lily said.
They ate their cookies and then played with their toys. They were different, but they were still twins. And they still loved each other."

The farmer sees the children being wasteful and disrespectful. He is sad and angry. He scolds the children for their bad manners.
""Shame on you, children, for wasting good cheese. Cheese is a gift from the cows and the land. You should be thankful and polite. If you don't like the cheese, you can say no thank you, but you don't have to throw it away or insult it. That is not smart or nice,"" the farmer says.
The children feel ashamed and sorry. They apologize to the farmer and the teacher. They promise to be more careful and respectful next time.

story-2668,"Mia and Ben were playing with clay. They liked to make different shapes and colors. Mia made a snake with green clay. She twisted it and made it long and curly. Ben made a ball with yellow clay. He rolled it and made it round and smooth.
""Look at my snake!"" Mia said. ""It can hiss and bite!""
""Look at my ball!"" Ben said. ""It can bounce and roll!""
They showed each other their clay creations. They were proud of them.
But then, a big boy came. He was older and taller than Mia and Ben. He was ignorant. He did not know how to play nicely. He saw the clay and wanted to take it.
""Give me your clay!"" he said. ""I want to make something better!""
He grabbed Mia's snake and Ben's ball. He smashed them together. He made a mess. He laughed.
Mia and Ben were sad and angry. They did not like the big boy. He was mean and rude.
""Hey, stop that!"" Mia said. ""That's our clay!""
""Go away!"" Ben said. ""You're not nice!""
But the big boy did not listen. He kept playing with the clay. He did not care about Mia and Ben.
Mia and Ben ran to their teacher. They told her what happened. The teacher was kind and fair. She went to the big boy. She scolded him. She made him give back the clay. She made him say sorry.
Mia and Ben got their clay back. They tried to fix their snake and ball. They thanked their teacher. They hugged each other.
They learned a lesson. They learned to share and respect. They learned to stand up for themselves. They learned to ignore ignorant people. They learned to be happy."
story-2669,"Lila and Tom were twins who liked to play outside. One day, they found a big pile of pebbles near the river. They decided to make a game with them. They each took some pebbles and threw them into the water, trying to make the biggest splash.
""Look, I found a shiny pebble!"" Lila said, holding up a smooth, black stone. ""It looks like a star!""
""Let me see!"" Tom said, reaching for the pebble. ""Maybe it has magic!""
Lila did not want to share. She hid the pebble in her pocket and ran away. Tom was angry and chased her. They ran and ran, until they came to a dark forest.
""Stop, Lila!"" Tom shouted. ""Give me the pebble!""
""No, it's mine!"" Lila shouted back. ""Go away!""
They did not see the big bear that was sleeping behind a tree. The bear heard their noise and woke up. He was hungry and angry. He saw the two children and roared.
Lila and Tom were scared. They tried to run away, but the bear was faster. He caught them and ate them. The pebble fell out of Lila's pocket and rolled into the river. It was gone.
The moral of the story is: Do not be greedy and selfish. Share with your brother or sister. And do not disturb a sleeping bear."
story-2670,"Lily was very hungry. She wanted to eat something yummy. She saw a big tray on the table. The tray had many things on it. There were cookies, cakes, fruits, and cheese. Lily thought the tray looked amazing.
She ran to the table and grabbed a cookie. She took a big bite. It was sweet and crunchy. She smiled and reached for a cake. She took another bite. It was soft and creamy. She was very happy and reached for a fruit.
But then she heard a loud voice. It was Mom. Mom was angry. She said, ""Lily, what are you doing? That tray is not for you. That tray is for the guests. You are very naughty. You did not ask. You did not accept what I gave you for lunch. You spoiled the tray. Now go to your room. No more treats for you today.""
Lily felt very sad. She dropped the fruit and started to cry. She did not understand. She thought the tray was for everyone. She thought Mom would be proud of her for trying new things. She did not mean to be naughty. She just wanted to eat something amazing.
She ran to her room and slammed the door. She hugged her teddy bear and sobbed. She wished she had accepted what Mom gave her for lunch. She wished she had not seen the tray. She wished she had not been so hungry. She wished Mom would forgive her. She wished she could have another cookie."
story-2671,"Ben and Lily wanted to play in the garden. They saw some big jars on the table. The jars had labels on them. The labels said: ""Do not touch. Dangerous.""
""What are these?"" Ben asked.
""I don't know. Maybe they are for Mom's plants,"" Lily said.
""Let's open them and see,"" Ben said. He reached for a jar.
""No, Ben, stop! The label says 'do not touch'. It is dangerous. It might hurt you,"" Lily said.
""But I want to see. Maybe it is something fun,"" Ben said. He did not listen to Lily. He opened the jar.
Suddenly, a loud noise came from the jar. Smoke and bubbles came out. Ben and Lily screamed. They ran away from the table.
Mom heard the noise and came to the garden. She saw the mess on the table. She saw Ben and Lily hiding behind a bush.
""What happened here?"" Mom asked.
""Ben opened a jar. It made a big boom. It was scary,"" Lily said.
""Ben, why did you open the jar? Didn't you see the label? It was dangerous. I was preparing a science experiment for your big brother. You could have hurt yourself or Lily,"" Mom said.
""I'm sorry, Mom. I was curious. I wanted to see what was inside,"" Ben said.
""Curiosity is good, but you have to be careful. You have to follow the rules. You have to respect the labels. They are there to protect you. Do you understand?"" Mom said.
""Yes, Mom. I understand. I won't do it again,"" Ben said.
""Good. Now, let's clean up this mess. And then, we can do something fun and safe together. How about we make some cookies?"" Mom said.
""Yay! Cookies!"" Ben and Lily said.
They hugged Mom and went to the kitchen. They learned their lesson. They never touched the jars again."
story-2672,"Lily and Sam were playing in the snow. They wanted to make an igloo, like the ones they saw in a book. They rolled big balls of snow and stacked them together. They left a hole for the door.
""Look, we made an igloo!"" Lily said. ""Let's go inside and pretend we live here.""
They crawled inside the igloo and sat on the floor. They felt cozy and warm. They pretended they had a fire and a pot of soup.
""What kind of soup do you want?"" Sam asked.
""I want spicy soup, like the one Mommy makes,"" Lily said.
""Me too,"" Sam said. ""But we don't have any spicy things here. Only snow.""
Sam had an idea. He crawled out of the igloo and looked around. He saw a red pepper in the garden. It was frozen, but still bright and shiny. He picked it up and brought it back to the igloo.
""Look, I found something spicy!"" he said. ""Let's put it in our soup.""
He broke the pepper in half and gave one piece to Lily. They both bit into it and smiled.
""Mmm, spicy!"" Lily said.
But then, they felt a burning sensation in their mouths. They gasped and coughed. Their eyes watered and their noses ran. They spit out the pepper and ran out of the igloo.
""Ow, ow, ow!"" they cried. ""That was too spicy!""
They ran to the house and asked Mommy for some water and milk. Mommy hugged them and gave them a glass each. She asked them what happened.
""We ate a spicy pepper from the garden,"" Lily said.
""We wanted to make spicy soup in our igloo,"" Sam said.
Mommy smiled and shook her head. She said, ""Next time, be careful what you put in your soup. And don't eat frozen peppers. They are not good for you.""
Lily and Sam nodded and drank their water and milk. They felt better and said sorry to Mommy. They learned their lesson. They decided to make a different kind of soup next time. Maybe carrot soup, or chicken soup, or tomato soup. But not spicy soup. Never again."
story-2673,"Sam and Mia were playing with their toys in the living room. Sam had a big truck with four wheels and a horn. Mia had a doll with a dress and a hat. They were having fun making noises and moving their toys around.
Then, Sam saw a shiny knob on the shelf. He liked shiny things and wanted to see what it was. He put down his truck and climbed on the couch to reach the knob. He took it in his hand and turned it. It made a click sound.
""Look, Mia, I found a knob!"" Sam said. ""It can make sounds. Do you want to play with it?""
Mia looked at the knob and shook her head. She did not like the knob. It was not pretty or soft like her doll. She wanted to keep playing with her doll.
""No, thank you, Sam,"" Mia said. ""I don't want the knob. You can have it.""
Sam felt sad. He wanted to share the knob with Mia. He thought it was a fun toy. He had an idea. He decided to sell the knob to Mia.
""Mia, do you want to buy the knob?"" Sam asked. ""I will sell it to you for one cookie. It is a good deal. The knob can make sounds and it is shiny.""
Mia looked at Sam and felt confused. She did not understand what he meant by sell and buy. She liked cookies, but she did not want the knob. She thought Sam was being silly.
""Sam, I don't want to buy the knob,"" Mia said. ""I don't have any cookies. And I don't like the knob. I like my doll. Why don't you play with your truck? It is a nice truck.""
Sam felt more sad. He did not want to play with his truck. He wanted to play with the knob. He did not know why Mia did not like the knob. He thought it was a great toy. He put the knob back on the shelf and climbed down from the couch. He picked up his truck and rolled it on the floor. He made a honk sound.
Mia saw that Sam was unhappy. She felt sorry for him. She wanted to make him happy. She had another idea. She decided to trade her doll for the knob.
""Sam, do you want to trade the knob for my doll?"" Mia asked. ""I will give you my doll and you give me the knob. Then we can both have new toys. It is a fun game.""
Sam looked at Mia and felt surprised. He did not expect her to offer her doll. He liked her doll. It was pretty and soft. He thought it was a nice toy. He smiled and nodded.
""Okay, Mia, let's trade the knob for the doll,"" Sam said. ""That sounds like a fun game. Thank you for being my friend.""
Mia smiled and nodded. She gave Sam her doll and took the knob. They hugged and said thank you. Then they played with their new toys. They were happy and had fun. They forgot about selling and buying. They learned about trading and sharing."

""Can we feed them?"" Lily asked Mom.
""No, sweetie, we can't. They have their own food,"" Mom said.
Tim saw a man with a bucket of fish. He was wearing a blue coat and a hat. He looked like he worked at the zoo.
""Maybe he can give us some fish to feed the penguins,"" Tim said. He ran to the man and said, ""Hello, sir. Can we have some fish, please?""
The man smiled and said, ""Sure, kid. You can have one fish each. But be careful, they might bite.""
He offered Tim and Lily a fish from the bucket. Tim and Lily thanked him and walked to the penguin pool. They held the fish in their hands and waved them at the penguins.
The penguins saw the fish and came closer. They made loud noises and flapped their wings. Some of them jumped out of the water and tried to grab the fish.
""Wow, they are hungry!"" Lily said.
But one penguin was different. He was smaller and quieter than the others. He stayed in the corner of the pool and looked sad.
""What's wrong with him?"" Tim asked.
""I don't know. Maybe he is sick or lonely,"" Lily said.
She felt sorry for the little penguin. She decided to give him her fish. She walked to the edge of the pool and said, ""Here, little penguin. This is for you. I hope you like it.""
She threw the fish to the penguin. He looked surprised and happy. He caught the fish in his beak and ate it. He waddled to Lily and rubbed his head against her hand. He made a soft noise.
""Aw, he likes you!"" Tim said.
Lily smiled and petted the penguin. He felt warm and soft. She said, ""You're welcome, little penguin. You're very cute.""
The penguin nodded and smiled. He followed Lily wherever she went. He wanted to be her friend.

He saw the little penguin and said, ""Oh, no. He's the new penguin. He just arrived yesterday. He's not used to the others. They don't like him. They bully him.""
He picked up the little penguin and said, ""Don't worry, little guy. I'll take you to the vet. He'll make you better.""
He thanked Tim and Lily for feeding the little penguin. He said, ""You're very kind, kids. You made him happy. He likes you. Maybe you can visit him again when he's well.""

story-2678,"Sara and Tom were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to make up stories with their dolls and cars. Sara had a big doll with long hair and a pink dress. Tom had a small car with four wheels and a horn.
""Let's pretend that my doll is a princess and your car is a dragon,"" Sara said. ""The dragon wants to take the princess to his cave, but she is frightened and wants to escape.""
""OK,"" Tom said. ""But the dragon is very strong and fast. He can catch the princess easily.""
Sara and Tom moved their toys around the floor, making noises and voices. Sara made her doll run away from Tom's car, but Tom chased her with his car, honking and growling.
""Help, help!"" Sara made her doll cry. ""The dragon is coming! He wants to lock me in his cave!""
""No one can help you, princess!"" Tom made his car say. ""You are mine now! I will part you from your friends and family!""
Sara did not like Tom's game. She felt scared and sad for her doll. She wanted to stop playing, but Tom did not listen. He grabbed her doll with his car and tried to pull her hair.
""Stop it, Tom!"" Sara shouted. ""You are hurting my doll! Give her back to me!""
""No, I won't!"" Tom shouted back. ""She is my prisoner! You can't have her!""
Sara and Tom started to tug and pull on the doll's hair. They both wanted to have the doll, but they did not want to share. They got angry and loud. They did not notice that their mom was watching them from the kitchen.
""Hey, hey, hey!"" their mom said. ""What is going on here? Why are you fighting over the doll?""
Sara and Tom stopped and looked at their mom. They felt ashamed and sorry. They realized that they had been mean and rude to each other.
""We were playing a game, mom,"" Sara said. ""But Tom was too rough and scary. He wanted to lock my doll in his cave and part her from me.""
""I was just pretending, mom,"" Tom said. ""But Sara did not like my game. She wanted to keep her doll and not let me play with her.""
Their mom sighed and shook her head. She walked over to them and took the doll from their hands. She looked at the doll's hair and saw that it was tangled and pulled.
""Look what you did to the doll,"" she said. ""You ruined her hair. How do you think she feels?""
Sara and Tom looked at the doll and felt bad. They saw that they had hurt the doll and each other.
""We are sorry, mom,"" they said. ""We are sorry, doll.""
Their mom smiled and hugged them. She gave them the doll back and helped them fix her hair.
""It's OK, my loves,"" she said. ""I know you were just playing, but you have to be careful and kind. You have to respect each other's toys and feelings. You have to share and take turns. And you have to use your words, not your hands, when you have a problem. OK?""
""OK, mom,"" Sara and Tom said. ""We understand. We will do better.""

""Can we go outside and see it?"" Tom asked. He wanted to get closer to the fire.
""No, no, no!"" Mom said. She came to the window and pulled them away. ""The fire is very hot and dangerous. You have to stay inside and be safe.""
""But why?"" Tom questioned. He did not understand why they could not go outside.
""Because the fire can hurt you and burn you. And the smoke can make you cough and sick. And the firemen have to work hard to stop the fire. You have to listen to Mom and stay inside."" Mom explained.
Lily and Tom were sad and curious. They wanted to see the fire, but they also wanted to be safe and healthy. They decided to listen to Mom and stay inside. They watched the fire from the window until it was gone. They hoped that no one was hurt by the fire. They thanked the firemen for their work. They learned that fire is not a toy, but a force of nature."

""We were feeding the ducks, but the goose came and took everything. It was greedy and nasty,"" Lily said.
The man nodded and said, ""I see. Well, you were kind and generous to the ducks, but you should also be careful and wise. The pond is not a safe place for kids and bikes. There are many animals and things that can hurt you. Next time, you should ride somewhere else, or ask your parents to come with you.""
